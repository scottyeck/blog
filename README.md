# blog

The posts collected under `posts` are (or if not yet, then they soon will be) published on my personal website: [scottyeck.com](http://scottyeck.com).

This respository is meant to achieve two purposes:

* Separates concerns, keeping the content of my blog isolated from the corresponding view layer.
* Maintains discussion in a public and familiar place, allowing commenters to submit pull-requests and improve the overall quality of the content.

## Contributing

To contribute, simply submit a pull-request, but be sure to include your name under the `contributors` section in the post's metadata block.
